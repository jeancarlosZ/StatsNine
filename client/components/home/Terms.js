          <p>
            There are risks associated with investing. Investing in stocks,
            bonds, exchange traded funds, mutual funds, and money market funds
            involve risk of loss, including principal. Some high risk
            investments may use leverage, which will increase gains and losses.
            Foreign investing involves special risks such as greater volatility,
            politics, economics, currency risks and accounting method
            differences. Past performance is not a guarantee or predictor of
            future investment performance.
